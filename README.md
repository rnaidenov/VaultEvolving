# VaultEvolving 🗂️

Hey there! Welcome to **VaultEvolving**, my space to share the journey of building and growing my Obsidian vault. I’m documenting the systems I create to learn, track, and evolve.

## What’s This About?
I’m using Obsidian to build personal workflows, like:
- A calorie-tracking system with ModalForms, QuickAdd, and Google Flash 2.0 to log food and macros.
- Journals!
- Project, workout, and habit trackers.
- Notes, plugins, and live experiments to improve how I learn and grow.

I’ll update this README and add branches with detailed README for each feature. 

Follow along on Twitter at [@VaultEvolving](https://twitter.com/VaultEvolving) for updates, or check out my threads to see the process in action!

## Why VaultEvolving?
This is my public evolution hub—a place to share what I’m figuring out with Obsidian, learn from feedback, and grow together. It’s all about the journey, not perfection.

## Get Involved
- Have ideas or suggestions? Open PRs or tweet me!
- Want to try it out? Clone this repo and explore the setup.
- Follow along for more systems, plugins, and notes as I build them.

Join the journey! 💪🏻
